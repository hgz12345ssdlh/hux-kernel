[ENG] [James's tutorial](http://www.jamesmolloy.co.uk/tutorial_html/) (and [Huan's duplication](http://wiki.0xffffff.org/)) is newbee-friendly but is rather old (2008). It adopts quite a lot of obselete techniques yet OS development has evolved a lot from then. Luckily, the OSDev community maintains an up-to-date [OSDev wiki](https://wiki.osdev.org/). It even collects [known bugs](https://wiki.osdev.org/James_Molloy's_Tutorial_Known_Bugs) found in James's tutorial. By combining these tutorials we shall be able to build a "modern" toy kernel.
